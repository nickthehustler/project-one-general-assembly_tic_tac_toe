#   Tic-Tac-Toe
#  General Assembly WDI6
#### April 6 2016
_Summary:_
This is my first project at a General Assembly student and foray into building anything as a newbie coder. I found the experience
to be enjoyable, but also frustrating because (1) we didn't have enough time or (2) my skill level is not high enough to
execute on my ideas. Here are some  major things I wanted to accomplish but didn't:
* a computer AI or intelligence to play against a human player
* a start game button...the game won't start until it is clicked
* a nicer looking prompt at the beginning when I ask which mark (X or O) should go first
* an improved UX with:
  * animations when a player selects a square
  * better color choices for the UI
  * better font choices for the X's and O's
